I fixed a problem with firebase where authentication was throwing errors and we were unable to pull the users information from the database (UID, email, pw). I also changed up our GUI / logic so that it is smoother:
	- Running the app will now bring you to the LOGIN page (Main Activity)
	- After successfully logging in, you can now enter the Chat Lobby where
	  you can:
		1) Chat with your specific UID/email displayed
		2) Go to the Game Homepage
		3) Logout

For this week's meeting with the client we developed the code to start a game
with just 1 user and 4 AI. It is very very rudimental and basically all hard-coded as of now. Basically the user is automatically given the role of Mafia, and 4 other player roles are generated as AI. The game then enters night phase and allows the user the vote on whom to kill. So we basically have the skeleton code for how the game logic should flow, we just need to implement a way to allow each unique user to receive a different view of day/night phase depending on their role. We hope to have it done this weekend in preperation for the demo next week.

Everyone's been busy this week, so we haven't been able to meet physically yet. Luc & Aneesh implemented some functionality's to ensure the proper number of players are entered in a game (minimum and, currently, the maximum should be 4). 

We decided to keep it simple and hardcode the moderator, leaving 4 player classes for users to be assigned (Mafia / doctor / cop / civilian).

Had problems where the project would load the previous run-times data, so I added a firebase function call called remove() at the beginning of mainActivity to clear the db and allow the app to run smoothly.

Added an option for users to create accounts on the spot rather than the accounts being hardcoded on our server.

More updates should come tomorrow (3/6/2016) when our group meets

STAN:

- Implemented individual Chat's unique for each player class (Mafia/Cop/...)
- Can now properly generate Player roles for users and store in database
- Can access said data to implement game logic 
	-> Which activities should be accessible for each role?
		- Mafia should be active during NightPhase
		- Civilian shouldn't
- Luc is now Head of UI and working hard to make our app look nice
- We are still finishing up the game logic but we have the pieces already, we 
need to put them together.
- Testing will be done on Monday, 3/7/2016.
