I fixed a problem with firebase where authentication was throwing errors and we were unable to pull the users information from the database (UID, email, pw). I also changed up our GUI / logic so that it is smoother:
	- Running the app will now bring you to the LOGIN page (Main Activity)
	- After successfully logging in, you can now enter the Chat Lobby where
	  you can:
		1) Chat with your specific UID/email displayed
		2) Go to the Game Homepage
		3) Logout

For this week's meeting with the client we developed the code to start a game
with just 1 user and 4 AI. It is very very rudimental and basically all hard-coded as of now. Basically the user is automatically given the role of Mafia, and 4 other player roles are generated as AI. The game then enters night phase and allows the user the vote on whom to kill. So we basically have the skeleton code for how the game logic should flow, we just need to implement a way to allow each unique user to receive a different view of day/night phase depending on their role. We hope to have it done this weekend in preperation for the demo next week.
