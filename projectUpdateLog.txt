I fixed a problem with firebase where authentication was throwing errors and we were unable to pull the users information from the database (UID, email, pw). I also changed up our GUI / logic so that it is smoother:
	- Running the app will now bring you to the LOGIN page (Main Activity)
	- After successfully logging in, you can now enter the Chat Lobby where
	  you can:
		1) Chat with your specific UID/email displayed
		2) Go to the Game Homepage
		3) Logout
